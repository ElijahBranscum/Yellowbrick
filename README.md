# Yellowbrick
Yellowbrick s an agency that provides their clients services such as life insurance, 401k plans, Annuities, and financial planning.. Yellowbrick is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.
My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of a drag-and-drop file upload component and create both a paginated client and user list. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend.
